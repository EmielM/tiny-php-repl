tiny-php-repl: tiny yet useful php repl featuring
- tumbling fork to preserve state when php crashes
- not dependent on php-readline (licensing issues), use separate /usr/bin/rlwrap
- changed sources are tracked, and dynamicly reloaded if runkit is installed
- around 75 loc 

issues/todo
- ctrl-d makes things go havoc
- not really checked if the children are killed in all scenarios
- it's ludicrous a socket_create_pair is used, we only need monodirectional
- not really checked if inheritence of the stdin fd is ok in all cases
